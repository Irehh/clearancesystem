Welcome to the most slightly patched-together project of the year! ðŸ¥³

So, what I did in this repo is that I already had a project named `unn-marketplace` (a name that changed more frequently than my mood). I edited it, added some stuff, and voilÃ â€”my final year project was born. Major kudos to Prajwal R(https://raiprajwal.com/) for being an absolute legend.

## What's This All About?
This clearance system isn't your run-of-the-mill project. Nope, it's a clearance system with a twist! The idea is simple: students upload scanned hard copies of the documents required for clearance. Why, you ask? Because my school hasn't quite caught up with the 21st century yet. You can check out the full project (warts and all) for free using this link(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TTQYrukhZsXIf62i6daAk5D3nXiTKFTH/view?usp=drive_link).
